# How to build a VSCode extension

This instruction help you out to build your own VSCode extension.
It might be simple but it is good enough for you to get started.

## Prerequisites

- Get VSCode IDE installed
- Install `yo` and `generator-code` packages

npm install -g yo generator-code
```

For me I choose `TypeScript`.
